GETTING STARTED
-----

The first thing you need to do is add 4 pages with the following **ids**:

- HOME (advanced settings->id:home)
- CONTACTS (advanced settings->id:contacts, template: content)
- PRIVACY (advanced settings->id:privacy, template: content page, single column)
- CONDUCT-CODE (advanced settings->id:conduct-code)

If you don't do that you'll start to see some errors like broken url reference. 
NOTE: You may need to restart the server after adding the pages to let the system
detect them.

ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
-----
(this documentation is in development, the structure of pages can be wrong)

For advanced configuration you can have more pages.

- CALENDAR (advanced settings->id:calendar)
  - CALL FOR PAPERS (advanced settings->id:cfp, template: content page, single column)
  - 
- ACCOUNTS
  - NEW ACCOUNT
  - PROFILE
  - AVATAR
  - 
- CONFERENCE
