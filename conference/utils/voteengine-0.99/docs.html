<h1>Documentation for VoteEngine 0.99</h1>
      
<p><b>VoteEngine comes with no warranty.  It may not work.  See the notice
 at the bottom of this document.</b>  </p>
   
<p>VoteEngine is actually made up of a few Python scripts.  As a result,
you need to have both Python, and the Numeric python package (Numpy) installed
 to use VoteEngine.&nbsp;  </p>
  <br>
 There are multiple ways to run VoteEngine. &nbsp;How you choose to do so 
will depend both on your own preference, and on the operating system you are
using.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Linux/Unix</b><br>
 
<blockquote>You'll probably want to run VoteEngine from the console/shell. 
&nbsp;You can do this by typing<br>
   
  <blockquote>python voteengine.py<br>
     </blockquote>
 VoteEngine uses the standard input and output. &nbsp;These may be re-directed 
as usual. &nbsp;If the execution bit is set for voteengine.py, you may be 
able to run it like this<br>
     
    <blockquote>./voteengine.py &lt;inputfile &gt;outputfile<br>
       </blockquote>
 If your system can run python scripts in that way.<br>
       </blockquote>
       
      <p></p>
       
      <p><b>Windows</b><br>
       </p>
       
      <blockquote>         
        <p>To run VoteEngine in Windows, double-click the ve.py script. &nbsp;This 
script looks for a file named "input.txt" and produces an output file called 
"output.txt". &nbsp;Just put whatever input you want into the "input.txt" 
file.<br>
         </p>
         </blockquote>
         
        <p><b>Python</b></p>
         
        <blockquote>           
          <p>If you have some knowledge of python, you can use the python 
console to run VoteEngine.<br>
           </p>
           
          <blockquote>from votemain import vote_engine<br>
 vote_engine(open("inputfile"),open("outputfile","w"),"-m borda")<br>
             </blockquote>
             </blockquote>
               
            <p>   </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h2>Input File</h2>
                  
            <p></p>
               
            <h3>Comments</h3>
                  
            <p>Comments may appear anywhere in the input file.  Any part of
an input line after a "#" is ignored.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands A-C # this comment will be ignored</dir>
                  
            <p></p>
               
            <h3>Commands</h3>
                  
            <p>Any line beginning with a "-" is interpreted as one or more 
commands.  Each new command on a line begins with its own "-" following a 
space of tab.  For example  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-m minmax -cands A-C -tie A B C</dir>
                  
            <p>This line provides three different commands.  Notice that the
hyphen in "A-C" does not introduce a new command, because there is no space
before it.  </p>
               
            <p>You may also place commands as initial arguments on the command 
line, for example  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>python voteengine.py &lt;test -m tideman -cands A-C</dir>
                  
            <p></p>
               
            <h3>-m ### choose method</h3>
                  
            <p>This command is required, and must precede all other commands, 
as well as the ballots.  This command allows you to choose the method for 
tabulation.  The following methods are available.  See <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/meltingpot/harrow/124/methods.html">

            <h3>-cands ### Designate candidates</h3>
                  
            <p>The "-cands" command is required.  It should come after the 
"-m" command, but before everything else.  </p>
               
            <p>The "-cands" command must be given a list of candidate designations 
that will be used in the various printouts provided by the programming.  Candidates
actual names would be too long, so instead each candidate is assigned a letter
or number.  This command allows you to specify a range for use by the candidates.
 For example  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands 1-12</dir>
                  
            <p>means that the numbers 1 through 12 will be used to designate 
candidates.  You can also use letters.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands A-F</dir>
                  
            <p>designates the candidates as A through F.  To allow more that 
26 candidates, VoteEngine allows you to make use of a letter sequence that 
proceeds A to Z, then AA to ZZ, then AAA to ZZZ and so on.  So, you can say, 
 </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands V-RS</dir>
                  
            <p>which means V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD &#8230; AZ, ZA, ZB, &#8230; RS
 </p>
               
            <p>You can also use special ranges that combine a letter and number
series, as follows  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands A1-C3</dir>
                  
            <p>This produces the sequence, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, 
C3.  </p>
               
            <p>It is important to note that only the &lt;letter&gt;&lt;number&gt; 
form is supported.  </p>
               
            <p>You don&#8217;'t have to use ranges, however, you can specify specific 
candidates, like  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands 7A AB Q R+ C&#8217; D</dir>
                  
            <p>More characters and sequences are legal in this form than in
a range. You can also combine ranges with separately specified candidates. 
 </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-cands A-F SQ RO</dir>
                  
            <p>For, example if you have designations with a special meaning. 
 For example "SQ" for Status Quo, or "RO" for re-open discussion.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h3>-tie ### tie breaking order</h3>
                  
            <p>It is possible that the ballots listed will result in a tie 
for the particular method chosen.  The "-tie" command allows you to list candidates
in an order that will be used to break ties, with the preferred candidates
listed earlier.  You must list all candidates.  </p>
               
            <p>/dir -tie A B C D  </p>
               
            <p>Just how the tie-breaking order will be used is dependent on
the method chosen.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h3>-table ## enter a table</h3>
                  
            <p>The table command allows you to enter pairwise data in the 
form of a table, rather than as ballots.  The table data is added to any other
data entered, so you could use this to sum two or more tables, if you wanted
to.  It only works if the selected method is exclusively a pairwise method.
 This includes the "table" method, which can be used to add up tables.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>-table                
            <p>#    A  B  C  D  </p>
               
            <p>A   X  5  3   7    # comments are allowed here  </p>
               
            <p>B   4   X  9   2  </p>
               
            <p>C  8   7   X  6  </p>
               
            <p>D 5   3   9   X</p>
  </dir>
                  
            <p>The table entry format is meant to be forgiving.  It counts 
back from the end of the line to determine how many words or numbers it reads 
in.  This means that you can put whatever you want at the beginning of the 
line and it will be ignored.  Similarly, you can put any single word in the 
long diagonal where the row and column are equal.  I prefer "X", as above, 
but you could also use "N/A" or 0, or anything else that is one word long. 
 </p>
               
            <p>You can also use comments to provide extra information, for 
example, column headers as above, or comments after the information on the 
line.</p>
            <h3>-zd ## zero out defeats</h3>
            <p>When a method uses a pairwise table, it normally uses the
marginal pairwise table. &nbsp;However, with this option you can cause the
procedure to zero-out defeats, resulting in a "winning-votes" table. &nbsp;
So, for example, 10 to 9 is treated like 10 to 0.<br>
  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h2>Ballots</h2>
                  
            <p>Here is an example ballot line.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>30: A B= C &gt; D E # comments allowed</dir>
                  
            <p>An "=" declares that two candidates are ranked as equal.  If
no equal sign is present, candidates are assumed to be listed in descending 
preference.  You may use a "&gt;" sign to express this, but one is not required. 
 Any candidates not listed are ranked as equal to one another, but lesser 
than all listed candidates.  </p>
               
            <p>The "30" says that 30 votes will be scored according to the 
ranking given.   </p>
               
            <p>If the number and colon are omitted, then it is assumed that 
only one ballot is being counted.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>A B C                
            <p>B C A  </p>
               
            <p>A C B</p>
  </dir>
                  
            <p>Each of the ballots above is scored as 1 vote.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h2>Output</h2>
                  
            <p>The output produced by VoteEngine varies with the method being 
used.  If you don&#8217;t use any method, the pairwise table is calculated, and 
the program exits.  </p>
               
            <p>Most methods will provide a ranking of the candidates.  Usually, 
this ranking will be straightforward.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <dir>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D</dir>
                  
            <p>This simply orders the candidates from highest (A) to lowest 
(D).  However, if some form of tie results, the ranking may be more complicated. 
 In this case, the "," is used to remain non-committal about the relative 
value of two candidates.  For example.  </p>
               
            <p>If a complete ranking cannot be determined, VoteEngine prints 
a Win/Loss/Unknown table.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
               
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                  
            <p>I hope to improve this program over time.  If you have any 
suggestions, especially of actual code, please let me know.  I don't expect 
many people to use this program, so I'm interested in hearing from anyone 
who does.  In any case, I hope you find VoteEngine useful.  </p>
               
            <p></p>
