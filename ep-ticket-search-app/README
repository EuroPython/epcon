Build Ticket Search App
-----------------------

    Creates a single-page fuzzy full text search list with all tickets
    and their ticket IDs.  Writes the single page to
    ep-ticket-search-app/index.html

    This can be used during registration to do quick search in the
    list of all tickets in order to find badges or find that no badge
    exists.

    Usage:

    cd ..
    ./manage.py build_ticket_search_app ep2016
    cd ep-ticket-search-app
    ./run.sh

    This will build the search app and start a web server running
    on port 8000. Pointing a browser at http://localhost:8000/ will
    then load the app into the browser.
