<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sponsor messages and recruiting</h4>
<p>
    Many of our sponsors support our conference to offer jobs and recruit good Python programmers.
    In addition to the official recruiting sessions, you might like to receive selected job offers
    via email, and evaluate them in a more private environment.
</p>
<p>
    Our top-tier sponsors may also want to send you special invites, perks,
    etc. in form of a few sponsor messages.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Your email address will never be shared with any of our
        sponsors</b> - the emails are sent by the EuroPython Organizers on
        behalf of the sponsors.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will only receive emails during the conference and in the week
        before and after the conference.
