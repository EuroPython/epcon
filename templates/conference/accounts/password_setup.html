                <h1>Please create a local password</h1>
                <h3> Why am I asked to do this?</h3>
                <p>
                We are asking you to create a local password for the EuroPython website to be
                able to authenticate you when using our chat server for the 2021 conference.
                This way you will not have to create a separate login onto another system.
                </p>
                <p>
                With this new local password you will be able to login into the EuroPython
                website directly as well as by using your Google account as you have been doing
                so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                We thank you for helping us out here and are really sorry for the (we hope
                small) inconvenience. For any question, feel free to
