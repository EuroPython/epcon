README
======
This project (and its dependencies) contains the EuroPython website source code.

The code is used for the EuroPython 2018 website.

LICENSE
=======
As a general rule, the whole website code is copyrighted by the Python Italia non-profit association, and released under the 2-clause BSD license (see LICENSE.bsd).

Some CSS files (within directories `p3/static/p4/s` and `p3/static/p5/s`) are instead explicitly marked as non-free; those files implement the current EuroPython website design and Python Italia wants to keep full rights on it. They are still published on GitHub as a reference for implementing a new design.

You are thus welcome to fork away and reuse/enhance this project, as long as you use it to publish a website with a new design (without reusing the current EuroPython design).
